# HW-1

I added semantic tags to improve the website and make it accessible for people with disabilities.
The following tags were added to index.html file:

<header> represents a container for the name of the company and includes a set of navigational links, using tag <nav> .
<aside> defines content aside from the page content on the left side.
<footer> tag defines a footer for the website.
<main> specifies the main content.
<section> to define sections for the website.
